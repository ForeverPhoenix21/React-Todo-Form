## Description:

<p> The React-Todo-Form is an input form exercise built-in React for the MITxPro web developer program. The input form was built as a CRUD todo list that is refactored, separating functions into components. </p>

## Installation:

<p> Upload the HTML file to your browser or fork and clone the project saving the files to your local hard drive. </p> 
<p>You can also run the program by clicking on the above picture in this readme file.</P>

## Usage:

<p> You can use the code from this project as a framework to understand parent/child relationships and how they work together using components. Add your own divs and style this todo list to your liking. </p>

## Roadmap:

*<p> This exercise will continually be built and improved on as I learn additional skills in Javascript. </p>*
